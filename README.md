# React Native AsyncStorage Data Retrieval Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where AsyncStorage in React Native intermittently fails to retrieve stored data correctly. The issue is seemingly random, making it difficult to pinpoint the cause. This example showcases the problem and a potential solution.

## Bug Description

The application uses AsyncStorage to store a simple key-value pair.  However, retrieving this data sometimes returns null or an unexpected value, despite the data being successfully stored previously. This behavior is inconsistent and may occur at different times during execution.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
5. Observe the app's output. You might need to run the app multiple times to observe the error.

## Solution

The provided solution implements error handling and retries to mitigate the intermittent failure.  It attempts to retrieve the data multiple times before giving up or displaying an error message. This isn't a guaranteed fix for all AsyncStorage issues but greatly improves the stability of data retrieval.
